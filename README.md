# PacManCpp
A simple PacMan-type console based game in CPP.

PacMan type game built using only arrays, while and for loops. The game features a playing character and 4 enemy characters. The movement of the enemy is random, but the enemies tend to follow the playing character and keep chasing it. The game is lost once the playing character collides with any of the enemy character and the game is won once the playing character has explored the whole map (eating all the points). Moreover sound effects and colors of text are used to make this console game as appealing as possibile.
